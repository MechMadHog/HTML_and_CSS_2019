<!-- Local Storage & Session Storage: -->
<!-- localStorage allows a webpage to store a users data.  -->
<!-- sessionStorage allows a webpage to store a users data temporarily.  -->
<!-- The User MUST be using a HTML5 Browser and have JavaScript turned on. -->
<!-- Example Script: -->
<script>
  if (typeof Storage !== "undefined") {
    // This site can accept localStorage
    alert("Accepted");
  } else {
    // This site is unable to accept localStorage
    alert("No localStorage accepted");
  }
</script>
<!-- Local Storage: will be available until a browser's cache is cleared.-->
<!-- Session Storage: will ONLY be available while  a browser's window is open. -->
<!-- Example Script: To store User data using localStorage.-->
<script>
  localStorage.myName = "Michael MacDonagh";
  //Stored in Local Storage.
  sessionStorage.myName = "Michael MacDonagh";
  //Stored in Session Storage.
</script>
<!-- Example Script: To access User data using localStorage. -->
<script>
  alert(localStorage.myName);
</script>
<!-- This will Output any names stored in localStorage using the myName variable. -->

<!-- In the past Cookies were used, but Cookies can only hold a small amount of data. -->
<!-- Unlike Cookies; localStorage can only be accessed from the website that it was Stored. -->
